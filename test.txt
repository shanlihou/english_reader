The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes

Chapter 1: A Scandal in Bohemia

I.

To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

Some of the many stories which the clients brought to Baker Street were strange enough, but none were more so than the experience which befell us in the spring of the year that saw Queen Victoria celebrate her fourth Jubilee. I had remained at my friend's bedside for several days, as he lay ill with a severe chill contracted during one of his investigations. The circumstances had been of the most exciting description, but though Holmes's nature was such that he shrank from all display of emotion, I knew him well enough to understand that the removal of the Lady Eva Bracknel from his reach had been a severe blow to his vanity, and that he brooding over it like a thoroughbredArabian who paws the ground in his stall and hears distant trumpet-calls, for the arena where he was accustomed to shine. The spring was still in the air, and the opportunity for his favorite sport of bicycling was presenting itself, when I was summoned to Baker Street by a telegram which ran:—

"Cannot do without you on Hurstmoncey case. Come to-day.—Lestrade."

I was the more ready to go because the Holmes case of which Lestrade spoke was one which had interested us both, and which might have had a very different termination but for the brilliant logic of my friend's methods. Though, after all, the business was finished and the criminal captured, it had left an unpleasant impression in my mind on account of the grave peril which had threatened the authorities through an unforeseen accident. It is true that the final result was all that could be desired, but Lestrade had been very seriously compromised, and he was an old friend of mine, so that I was very glad to have an opportunity of giving him what help I could.

The telegram had come from the local constable at Hurstmoncey, and I was able to send a brief reply that I would take the first train, and be with him before evening.

III.

The little country town of Hurstmoncey, in the county of Sussex, lay at the foot of the South Downs, a long, low hill which rose to a height of some three hundred feet above the sea-level. It was a place of considerable antiquity, dating back to the time of the Danes, as its name would seem to indicate, and it had been the scene of several important events in the history of England. The village itself was pleasantly situated in a valley, and the little white cottages with their red-tiled roofs gave it an air of comfort and prosperity.

The train which I had taken at Victoria Station brought me to Hurstmoncey at about half-past four in the afternoon, and I found Lestrade waiting for me on the platform. He was a man of middle height, with a slight stoop, and he wore a pair of spectacles which gave him a somewhat scholarly appearance. He looked relieved to see me.

"How good of you to come, Watson," said he, as we shook hands. "I am afraid that this affair is going to be a most troublesome one. It is a capital mistake to get mixed up in the private affairs of the great, as Holmes is so fond of saying, but in this case I am afraid that the great have mixed themselves up in mine."

"Let me have the facts, Lestrade," said I, as we walked from the station.

"The facts are these," replied Lestrade. "On Thursday evening a telegram was received at the police-station from London, stating that a valuable parcel had been stolen from a railway carriage, and that the thief had been traced to Hurstmoncey. The telegram was signed by Inspector Gregson, of Scotland Yard, and it asked us to hold the thief until he could come down."

"And you did so?"

"Yes, we arrested a man who answered the description. He is a tall, dark man, about thirty years of age, and he was found in the railway carriage from which the parcel had been stolen. He had a considerable sum of money in his possession, and he behaved in a very suspicious manner when questioned. However, he protests his innocence, and declares that he knows nothing about any parcel."

"And what was in the parcel?"

"That is the peculiar part of the affair. The parcel was found, empty, in a ditch about a mile from the station. It had been opened, and the contents removed. The only thing left was a piece of paper with some writing on it."

Lestrade produced a small piece of paper, on which were written the following words in a bold, clear hand:—

"The game is afoot. Do not attempt to follow the hounds, for they will lead you into a country from which there is no return. The man who follows me will find his grave, and the woman who seeks me will find her death. I give you this warning for the last time."

"The man who wrote this," said Lestrade, "must be either a madman or a desperate character. The person to whom it is addressed is unknown, but the packet was undoubtedly stolen from the carriage in which it was being conveyed."

"And what steps have you taken?"

"We have questioned the man we arrested, but he knows nothing about it. He says that he was simply travelling to Hurstmoncey on business, and that he had never seen the parcel before. He is a clerk in a London office, and he gave us the name of his employer, which we have verified. He has a clean record, and there seems to be no reason to suspect him."

"Then the thief must be someone else."

"That is what I think. The parcel was stolen from the carriage between Victoria and Hurstmoncey. The only person who had access to it was the guard, and the guard declares that he never left the carriage. But there is another possibility. The parcel might have been removed from the carriage at one of the intermediate stations, and then replaced by an empty one. This would require the co-operation of the thief with someone on the train."

"And you think that the person who sent the telegram is concerned in the matter?"

"I am inclined to think so. Inspector Gregson is an old friend of mine, and he would not have sent such a telegram without good reason. But why should he wish to involve us in this affair? That is what I cannot understand."

We had arrived at the police-station, and Lestrade led me to a small room where a man was sitting at a table, writing. He looked up as we entered, and I saw a pale, anxious face, with a small black mustache. He was about thirty years of age, and he was dressed in a suit of dark blue, which had seen better days.

"This is Mr. John Smith," said Lestrade. "He is the man we arrested."

I shook hands with Smith, and found him to be a quiet, well-spoken man. He seemed to be genuinely puzzled by the whole affair, and he gave me his account of what had happened on the journey.

"I was travelling from Victoria to Hurstmoncey on Thursday evening," said he. "I had taken a first-class ticket, and I was sitting alone in a compartment. The train stopped at several stations, but I did not leave my seat. I had a small bag with me, containing some papers which I needed for my business in Hurstmoncey. I did not see any parcel, and I know nothing about any theft."

"And you have no idea who might have sent this telegram?" I asked, showing him the paper.

He read it carefully, and his face grew paler. "This is a very strange thing," said he. "I have never seen this writing before, and I have no idea who might have sent it. But I am convinced that there is some mistake. I am innocent of any crime."

"I am sure you are," said I. "We shall do our best to clear up this affair."

Lestrade and I then retired to another room, where we could talk more freely.

"This is a most perplexing case," said Lestrade. "The man seems to be telling the truth, and yet the parcel has been stolen. And who is this mysterious person who sent the telegram? And what is the meaning of that warning?"

"I think," said I, "that the best thing we can do is to find out more about this person. The writing on the paper is in a bold, clear hand, which suggests that the writer was not trying to conceal his identity. And the tone of the warning is such as might be used by someone who considered himself to be in a position of authority."

"You mean that it might be someone in authority? Perhaps an official of some kind?"

"That is possible. But who would have any reason to involve us in this affair? And what is the purpose of the warning?"

"I am afraid I cannot answer that," said Lestrade. "But we must find out who sent this telegram. Let me go to the post-office and make inquiries."

He left me alone with Smith, who seemed very much upset by the whole affair.

"I am sure that there is some mistake," said he. "I have never done anything wrong in my life, and I cannot understand why anyone should wish to implicate me in this affair."

"You may rest assured that we shall do everything in our power to clear this matter up," said I. "But in the meantime, I must ask you to remain in Hurstmoncey. You will be comfortable at the local inn, and we shall need to speak with you again."

"I understand," said Smith. "I am quite willing to do whatever is necessary."

Lestrade returned after a short absence, and he seemed excited.

"I have found out something," said he. "The telegram was sent from the post-office in Victoria Station, and it was handed in by a man who was wearing a dark overcoat and a hat pulled down over his eyes. The clerk who took the telegram says that he did not see the man's face clearly, but he described him as being of medium height and build. The man paid for the telegram in cash, and he left immediately after handing it in."

"That is not very helpful," said I. "But perhaps we can find out more from the telegram itself. Who was it addressed to?"

"It was addressed to Inspector Gregson, at Scotland Yard. That is how we came to be involved."

"So the person who sent the telegram was aware that Inspector Gregson would call upon us for assistance."

"That seems to be the case. And it suggests that the person has some knowledge of police methods."

"And it also suggests that the person wishes us to know that he is aware of our actions."

Lestrade nodded. "That is what I think. But why should he wish to warn us? And what is the purpose of the whole affair?"

I was about to reply when we heard a knock at the door. Lestrade opened it, and a man entered. He was tall and well-dressed, and he carried himself with the air of authority.

"Good evening," said the man. "I am Inspector Gregson, from Scotland Yard. I have come down to Hurstmoncey in connection with the parcel theft."

"Ah, Mr. Gregson," said Lestrade, shaking hands. "We were expecting you. This is Dr. Watson, who has come to assist us."

"How do you do?" said Gregson, as we shook hands. "I am glad to have your help, Dr. Watson. This is a most unusual case."

"Can you tell us more about the parcel?" I asked.

"The parcel contained some important documents," said Gregson. "They were being sent to a client in Hurstmoncey, and their loss would be a serious matter. The theft was discovered when the train arrived at its destination, and the parcel was found to be missing. The guard reported that he had seen a man leave the train at one of the intermediate stations, but he was unable to identify him."

"And what do you make of this warning?" I asked, showing him the paper.

Gregson read it carefully, and his face grew grave. "This is the most extraordinary thing," said he. "I have never seen anything like it. The tone is such as might be used by someone who considered himself to be above the law. And the reference to 'the game' suggests that this might be some kind of sporting affair."

"Do you think that it might be a practical joke?" asked Lestrade.

"It is possible," said Gregson. "But I doubt it. The theft of the parcel was a serious matter, and the person who wrote this warning must have been aware of it. And the fact that the telegram was sent to me suggests that the writer has some knowledge of police procedures."

"And what do you think that we should do?"

"I think that we should try to find out more about this person. The writing is in a bold, clear hand, which suggests that the writer was not trying to conceal his identity. And the tone of the warning is such as might be used by someone who considered himself to be in a position of authority."

"Are you suggesting that it might be someone in authority? Perhaps an official of some kind?"

"That is possible. But I cannot think of anyone who would have any reason to involve us in this affair. And what is the purpose of the warning? That is what I cannot understand."

We were interrupted by a knock at the door. Lestrade opened it, and a man entered. He was tall and thin, with a pale face and a small black mustache. He carried himself with an air of superiority, and he wore a suit of the finest quality.

"Good evening," said the man. "I am Sir Henry Baskerville. I believe that you are investigating the theft of a parcel."

"Ah, Mr. Baskerville," said Lestrade. "Yes, we are. But how did you know about it?"

"I am the person to whom the parcel was being sent," said Baskerville. "I have just arrived in Hurstmoncey, and I was told that the parcel had been stolen."

"I am very sorry about that," said Lestrade. "We are doing our best to recover it. But I must ask you some questions."

"Certainly," said Baskerville. "I am quite willing to answer any questions that you may have."

"What can you tell us about the contents of the parcel?"

"The parcel contained some very important documents," said Baskerville. "They were the title-deeds to an estate which I have recently inherited. Their loss would be a serious matter, as I need them to prove my ownership of the property."

"And who knew that you were expecting these documents?"

"Very few people," said Baskerville. "My solicitor knew, and a few members of my family. But I cannot think of anyone who would have any reason to steal them."

"And what do you think of this warning?" I asked, showing him the paper.

Baskerville read it carefully, and his face grew pale. "This is most extraordinary," said he. "I have never seen anything like it. The tone is such as might be used by someone who considered himself to be above the law. And the reference to 'the game' suggests that this might be some kind of sporting affair."

"Do you think that it might be a practical joke?" asked Lestrade.

At this point, I began to suspect that we were involved in a most extraordinary adventure, and that the theft of the parcel was only the beginning of a much larger and more dangerous conspiracy. The warning which we had received was clearly intended to deter us from pursuing our inquiries, and the fact that it had been sent to Inspector Gregson suggested that the writer had some knowledge of police methods and was aware that we would be called upon to assist in the investigation.

I was convinced that the whole affair was far from over, and that we would soon find ourselves in the midst of a most exciting and dangerous adventure. Little did I know how correct I was, and how much danger lay ahead of us.
